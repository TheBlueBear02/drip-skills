### Design Decisions

**Why multi-value border-radius and not a simple `border-radius: 24px`?**
Standard single-value radius produces a perfect geometric arc — the corners
look like they were generated by software. Multi-value syntax creates asymmetric
elliptical corners: each corner has a different horizontal and vertical radius.
The result is organic and unpredictable — like a shape drawn by hand.
`255px 15px 225px 15px / 15px 225px 15px 255px` creates wildly different
curves on each corner. This is the single most important visual decision.

**Why hard 4px offset shadows and never blur?**
Blurred box-shadows simulate diffused light around a 3D object. That's wrong
for this system — we're not simulating 3D. We're simulating paper cutouts.
When you stack two pieces of paper, the top casts a hard-edged shadow on
the bottom. `4px 4px 0px 0px #2d2d2d` is that shadow — a solid rectangle
offset by 4px. Zero blur because paper on paper has no diffusion.

**Why 100ms linear transitions?**
Slow, graceful transitions (300–500ms ease-out) belong to premium/botanical
systems that want to feel luxurious. This system wants to feel spontaneous
and immediate — like picking up a piece of paper. 100ms linear feels snappy
and alive. The jiggle (rotation shift on hover) reinforces playfulness.

**Why Kalam and Patrick Hand?**
Kalam at 700 weight has the energy of a thick felt-tip marker. Strokes have
real weight variation and the letterforms are recognizably hand-drawn without
being illegible. Patrick Hand is what your smart friend's notes look like —
not messy, just distinctly human. System fonts (Inter, Roboto) would completely
destroy the aesthetic. One line of system font in this design is like a
laser-printed label in a handmade journal.

**Why #2d2d2d and not #000000?**
Pure black is a digital invention. Real pencil lead on paper is dark gray.
`#2d2d2d` is the color of soft pencil lead — dark enough to read clearly,
but with enough warmth to feel physical rather than digital.

| Border | 2px pencil, wobbly multi-value | 4px black, hard sharp | 1px stone, thin | 1px green glow |
| Shadow | Hard 4px offset, zero blur | Hard 4–8px offset, zero blur | Soft diffused bloom | Neon glow |
| Button | Oval wobbly, press-flat | Sharp rect, stamp-press | Full pill, slow hover | Pixel block |
| Radius | Extreme multi-value (255px/15px) | 0px or 9999px only | 24px or 9999px | 0px always |
| Font | Kalam + Patrick Hand (handwritten) | Space Grotesk 900 | Playfair + Source Sans | Courier Mono |
