# TOKENS — SPACING

## Contained Like a Sketchbook Page

The layout feels like it lives within the bounds of a notebook page.
Not sprawling. Max width contained. Sections have generous rhythm.

## Scale

| Usage | Value | Tailwind |
|---|---|---|
| Between elements | 16–32px | `gap-4 gap-8` |
| Card internal padding | 24–32px | `p-6 p-8` |
| Section vertical padding | 80px | `py-20` |
| Grid gaps | 32px | `gap-8` |
| Max width | 1024px | `max-w-5xl` |
| Focused content | 768px | `max-w-3xl` |

`py-20` (80px) for every section — consistent vertical rhythm.

## Container

```
Max width:  max-w-5xl (1024px) — sketchbook page width
Padding:    px-6 (mobile) → px-8 (desktop)
```

Narrower than typical (max-w-7xl). The contained feel is intentional.
Everything feels like it fits on one spread of a large notebook.

## Rotation Grid

Elements get mild tilts at rest:
```
Cards:    -1deg or +1deg alternating
Labels:   +1 to +2deg
Decor:    -2 to +3deg for energy
```
