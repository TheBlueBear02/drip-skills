# TOKENS — SHADOWS

## The Core Rule
Shadows are absent, relying on color and contrast to establish visual hierarchy and depth within the design.

## Shadow Scale
None: This skill adheres to a flat aesthetic with no drop shadows or depth effects.

## Interaction Pattern (hover/active states with shadow)
Instead of shadows, hover states slightly darken the element background or change the element border color.

## Rules
1. Avoid all forms of shadow or depth effects.
2. Use border color changes for interactive feedback.
3. Maintain flat design principles to ensure a clean aesthetic.
