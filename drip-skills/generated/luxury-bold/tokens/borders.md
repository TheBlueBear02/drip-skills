# TOKENS — BORDERS & RADIUS

## The Core Rule
Maintain sharp and definitive edges with all borders; no radius is utilized to achieve clarity and precision.

## Border Width Table
| Context | Width | Color |
|--|--|--|
| General | 1px | #FFFFFF |

## Radius Scale
| Token | Value | Tailwind | Used For |
|--|--|--|--|
| none | 0px | rounded-none | All elements |

## Rules
1. Borders are used sparingly and should always be 1px in solid white.
2. Use borders for emphasis only, such as on cards or sections.
3. No element should have rounded corners.
4. Maintain consistent border usage across all component types.
