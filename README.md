GetDRIP is a design system distribution platform built around the concept of "skills" — complete, opinionated design systems (neo-brutalism, art deco, clay, retro terminal, etc.) that developers can install into their React projects with a single CLI command (npx getdrip add <skill-name>). The project has four main parts: drip-cli, an npm package that handles downloading, extracting, and wiring up skills from a GitHub source with auto-dependency installation; drip-skills, the library of ~10 production-ready design systems, each a comprehensive "playbook" containing philosophy docs, design tokens, Tailwind config, CSS variables, and example components structured specifically to be AI-friendly (so an AI agent can reason about and extend the design language); drip-site, a React/Vite marketing site with a live theme switcher that lets users preview all skills interactively before installing; and example projects demonstrating real integrations. The core insight driving the project is that generic AI-generated UIs all look the same, and GetDRIP solves this by giving developers (and their AI coding assistants) a fully-specified, constrained visual language to work within — described by the tagline "Stop shipping generic AI UIs."
